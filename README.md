# Rampage
Linux memory scanner/editor written in python. Similar to scanmem, artmoney, or cheat engine in concept. Allows you to find values of programs in RAM and then change them. 

## Installing

Depends on python-ptrace and the custom scanning library written in C - see cscan folder.

1. Install python-ptrace

    pip install python-ptrace

2. Install cscan

    cd cscan
    python setup.py install

3. (Optional) compile the demo app

    cd demo
    make

## Usage

Launch a program you want to scan, find its pid and figure out what value you want to edit. The demo program conviniently provides all of the above. The demo program will exit if it detects the value being changed to 0xDEADBEEF.

```
>>> p = Process(pid)
>>> p.attach()
>>> p.scan(12)
8368
>>> p.scan(1804289383)
1
>>> m.update()
>>> m
[<Match 0x7ffbffffaecc - 846930886 in <MemorySegment [stack]>>]
>>> m.set(0xdeadbeef)
```
